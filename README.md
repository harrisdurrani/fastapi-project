# This project is meant as practice for data analytics/engineering concepts. 

### My goal is to create a fully functioning API that does read and write operations to track changes to a catalog for books similar to a library.
### My tools include python 3.11, FastAPI, Pandas and SQLite
### I will periodically include comments that track current changes to showcase progress.
