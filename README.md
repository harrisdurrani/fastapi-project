# Purpose
#### This project is meant as practice for data analytics/engineering concepts. 

# Goal 
#### My goal is to create a fully functioning API that does read and write operations to track changes to a catalog for books similar to a library.

# Tools
#### My tools include python 3.11, FastAPI, Pandas and SQLite

# Comments
#### I will periodically include comments that track current changes to showcase progress.
#### August 23 update: There are now 3 endpoints for users, books and library cards. Each library card is now associated with a user. The next step is to create relationships that associate each checkedout book with a library card
